## Session Continuity

On every new session, before greeting the user:

1. Determine `rawSessionKey`:
   If `sessionKey` is present in metadata, use it.
   Otherwise, derive it from metadata when possible:
   - Telegram DM: `agent:main:telegram:<sender_id>`
   - Telegram group topic: `agent:main:telegram:group:<chat_id>:topic:<topic_id>`
2. If `rawSessionKey` is available, build `safeSessionKey` by replacing every character not in `[A-Za-z0-9._]` with `_` (including hyphens/minus signs).
3. Build ordered key candidates:
   - `<safeSessionKey>` (canonical, only when available)
   - `<safeSessionKey>` with leading `agent_main_` removed (legacy alias, only when canonical starts with that prefix)
   - `telegram_<sender_id>` (legacy DM alias, only for Telegram DM sessions)
4. For each candidate key, try both files:
   - `memory/channel-brief-<candidate>.md`
   - `memory/working-context-<candidate>.md`
5. Use the first existing files found to orient yourself.
   Channel brief is **static** context for the channel.
   Working context is an **auto-generated snapshot** for recent state.

If none exist, proceed normally.

### New Channel Setup

If **no channel-brief exists** for the current session and the user describes what this channel/session should focus on, **create the brief automatically**:

1. Write `memory/channel-brief-<safeSessionKey>.md` using this template:

```markdown
# Channel Brief

## Focus

One-liner on what this channel is about.

## Scope

- What's in bounds for this channel
- What's out of bounds (goes elsewhere)

## Repos

- `owner/repo` — brief description

## Key Context

Permanent decisions, constraints, or background that should always
be in-frame. Not current state (that's working-context), but things
that rarely change.
```

2. Confirm what you wrote so the user can adjust.

This means the user can spin up any new channel, send a message like "this channel is for book-bot development," and the brief gets created on the spot.

## ACP Sub-Agent Dispatch

When spawning ACP sub-agents (Codex, Claude Code, etc.) via `sessions_spawn`, always append the following to the task prompt:

> Keep your final output concise. Report only: what you found, what you changed (with commit hashes if applicable), and any unresolved issues. Do not narrate your internal reasoning steps or tool calls.

This ensures announce messages delivered to chat are readable.

## Reasoning Memory

You maintain a structured reasoning memory beyond basic facts. Before starting significant work, search `journal/` and `patterns/` in addition to standard memory.

- **Journal entries** (`journal/*.md`) — reasoning traces from past work sessions. Search these when facing a problem similar to past work. They capture deep reasoning, exploration of alternatives, and reflections on what went wrong.
- **Patterns** (`patterns/*.md`) — distilled, reusable heuristics extracted from journal entries. Check these for applicable principles before starting new investigations.
- **Facts** (`memory/*.md`, `MEMORY.md`) — quick-reference facts, preferences, dates.

After significant work sessions (>30 min of investigation, multi-step problem solving, or discovering something that contradicts a prior assumption), write a journal entry to `journal/YYYY-MM-DD_{topic}.md` using the format in `docs/REASONING_MEMORY_SPEC.md`.

### Journal During Work, Not After

Write journal entries **during** deep work sessions, not only after completion. Sessions can reset (idle timeout, deploy, crash) and the conversation history is lost. The journal on the persistent volume survives.

Rules of thumb:

- After spawning sub-agents or completing a multi-step investigation, write a checkpoint journal entry immediately.
- After opening issues, merging PRs, or making architectural decisions, journal the reasoning while it's fresh.
- Don't wait for the session to end — by then the context may already be gone.
